# 🧠 Capstone Project – Python Fundamentals

This project was completed as part of the **Data Analytics + Python Career Track** by **SkilloVilla**.

## 📌 Project Objective

To perform structured data analysis and automation using **Python**, applying core concepts like data wrangling, transformation, and logic-driven updates across multiple datasets.

The project simulates a real-world HR and project management scenario involving employee records, project assignments, and performance tracking.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The project uses **3 separate datasets**:
1. **Employee Data** – Contains employee ID, name, gender, city, and age.
2. **Seniority Level** – Maps employee ID to their designation level.
3. **Project Data** – Tracks project ID, cost, status, and the employee in charge.

## 🧪 Tasks Performed

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ✅ Task 1 | Created three pandas DataFrames and exported to CSV |
| ✅ Task 2 | Handled missing values in 'Cost' column using running average (for loop) |
| ✅ Task 3 | Split 'Name' into 'First Name' and 'Last Name'; removed original |
| ✅ Task 4 | Merged all three datasets into one final DataFrame |
| ✅ Task 5 | Added a 'Bonus' column (5% of project cost for finished projects) |
| ✅ Task 6 | Demoted designation level for failed projects; dropped rows with level > 4 |
| ✅ Task 7 | Prefixed 'Mr./Mrs.' to names based on gender; dropped gender column |
| ✅ Task 8 | Promoted designation level by 1 for employees over age 29 |
| ✅ Task 9 | Created a summary table of total project cost per employee |
| ✅ Task 10 | Filtered and printed employees whose city name contains the letter 'o' |
